# python-skeleton
A skeleton for a new python project

The purpose of this repo is to serve as an example of how to setup a python project. It can be annoying to get all the fiddly bits right at the start, this is meant to be a guide. You can use the repo as is, or just copy and paste the bits you need.

It contains the basics for a module, an executable script, and a test framework.
